### PROBLEM STATEMENT
# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree

# Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

# Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
# Root Node (3) is always a good node.
# Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
# Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
# Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

# Example 3:
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Root is considered as good.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.count = 0
        self.helper(root, root.val)
        return self.count
    
    def helper(self, node, max_so_far):
        if not node:
            return
        if node.val >= max_so_far:
            self.count += 1
        max_so_far = max(node.val, max_so_far)
        self.helper(node.left, max_so_far)
        self.helper(node.right, max_so_far)
